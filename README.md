## Description
The **Simple Shell** project is a command-line interpreter created in the C programming language. It mimics the behavior of the UNIX shell and allows users to execute commands interactively or non-interactively.

This program was developed as part of the curriculum at **Holberton School** to understand low-level programming, system calls, processes, and how shells work.
